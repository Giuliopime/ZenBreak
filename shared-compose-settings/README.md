# shared-compose-settings
This module contains a functional material 3 settings UI that uses the shared-core module for its logic.  
To work it just requires a `IZenBreakViewModel`, which creation and handling is platform specific, even though a `DefaultZenBreakViewModel` is available with basic functionalities.  

##Â Development
This is not meant to be used in the `../multiplatformApp` so there are no instruction on how to build this for iOS, even thought the process is the same as for the `../shared-compose-popup` module.
